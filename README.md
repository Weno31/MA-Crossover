# MA-Crossover
This project is a Streamlit-based financial backtesting application that implements a Moving Average (MA) Crossover Strategy using historical stock index data. It allows users to interactively select global indices, set strategy parameters, and visualize the performance of a simple MA-based trading algorithm against a traditional buy-and-hold approach.
